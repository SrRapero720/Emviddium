# WHAT IS EMVIDDIUM
Emviddium is a Forge port of Nvidium. 
Currently, this port is a PoC because I CANT TEST IT.
I had plans to do a proper release until I got the needed hardware (GTX 1660) 
to properly test it, fix bugs and contribute to the official project)

## WHAT IS NVIDIUM
> **IMPORTANT:** Requires sodium and a nvidia gtx 1600 series or newer to run (turing+ architecture)

Nvidium is an alternate rendering backing for sodium, it uses cutting-edge nvidia features to render huge amounts of
terrain geometry at very playable frame rates.
